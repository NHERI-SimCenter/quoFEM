+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

This example uses quoFEM to estimate the first and second central
moments of a FE model's response, given the marginal distributions of
various random parameters.

Consider the problem of uncertainty quantification in a two-dimensional
truss structure shown in the following figure. Two input scripts are
used to define a forward propagation procedure to be coordinated by
quoFEM which will estimate the mean and standard deviation of the
vertical displacement at node 3 using Latin hypercube sampling.

   :alt: This is a technical drawing of a truss structure for engineering analysis. It includes numerical labels at key points and shows the dimensions of the truss, with lengths marked as 4 meters. There are also two downward pointing forces, labelled P, applied at two nodes of the truss. The logo for OpenSees, which is software for structural engineering simulation, appears in the upper right corner of the image.

The following parameters are defined in the **RV** tab:

1. Elastic modulus, ``E``: **Weibull** distribution with a scale
   parameter :math:`(\lambda)` of :math:`210.0`, shape parameter
   :math:`(k)` of :math:`20.0`,

2. Load magnitude, ``P``: **Beta** distribution with a first shape
   parameter :math:`(\alpha)` of :math:`2.0`, second shape parameter
   :math:`(\beta)` of :math:`2.0`, lower bound :math:`(L_B)` of
   :math:`20.0`, upper bound :math:`(U_B)` of :math:`30.0`,

3. Cross sectional area for the other six bars, ``Ao``: **Lognormal**
   distribution with a mean :math:`(\mu)` of :math:`250.0`, standard
   deviation :math:`(\sigma)` of :math:`50.0`,

4. Cross sectional area for the upper three bars, ``Au``: **Normal**
   distribution with a mean :math:`(\mu)` of :math:`500.0`, standard
   deviation :math:`(\sigma)` of :math:`100.0`,

UQ Workflow
-----------

To define the uncertainty workflow in quoFEM, select **Forward
Propagation** for the **Dakota Method Category**, and enter the
following inputs:

+---------------+-------+
| **Method**    | LHS   |
+---------------+-------+
| **Samples**   | 200   |
+---------------+-------+
| **Seed**      | 949   |
+---------------+-------+

Model Files
-----------

The following files make up the **FEM** model definition.

#. `model.tcl <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claudioperez/SimCenterExamples/master/static/truss/model.tcl>`__:
   This file is an OpenSees Tcl script that constructs and runs a finite
   element analysis of the truss for a given realization of the
   problem's random variables. It is supplied to the **Input File**
   field of the **FEM** tab.

#. `post.tcl <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claudioperez/SimCenterExamples/master/static/truss/post.tcl>`__:
   This file is an OpenSees Tcl script that processes the QoI
   identifiers supplied in the **QoI** tab, and writes the relevant
   response quantities to ``results.out`` from an OpenSees process. It
   is supplied to the **Postprocess File** field of the **FEM** tab.


Results
-------

The results from this analysis with a maximum of :math:`200` iterations
are as follows:

**Node 3**:

-  :math:`\mu = 7.6986`
-  :math:`\sigma = 1.5666`

**Node 2**:

-  :math:`\mu = 9.3967`
-  :math:`\sigma = 1.8628`

If the user selects **Data** in the **RES** tab, they will be presented
with both a graphical plot and a tabular listing of the data. Various
views of the graphical display can be obtained by left- and
right-clicking the columns of the tabular data. If a singular column of
the tabular data is selected with simultaneous right and left clicks, a
frequency and CDF will be displayed.

   This example may run up to 60 minutes depending on the computer performance. For a quick test, the user may want to reduce **Max Computation Time**.
   

Outline
-------

This example constructs a Gaussian process-based surrogate model for the response of a building structure given a ground motion time history. We are interested in the maximum inter-story drift/acceleration response determined in 14 structural parameters.

Input files
-------------
Once the user selects OpenSeesPy as FEM applications, below three fields are requested.

1. **Input Script** - ``CWH.py``: This file is the main Python script that builds the model and runs the analysis. It is supplied to the Input Script field of the FEM tab. Because this file writes directly to results.out, it obviates the need for supplying a post-process script.
2. **Postprocess Script (Optional)** - None: This optional script is not required.
3. **Parameters File** - ``params.py``: This file is a Python script that defines the problemâ€™s random variables. The **RV tab** will be auto-populated when this file is loaded. The literal values which are assigned to variables in this file will be varied at runtime by the UQ engine.


**The other subsidiary scripts (including ground motion time history) are stored in the same directory of the main input script.**

UQ Workflow
-------------

1. Start the application, and the **UQ** Selection will be highlighted. Change the UQ Engine to **SimCenterUQ** and the Method Category to **Training GP Surrogate Model**. Since the model is provided, the Training Dataset will be obtained by **Sampling and Simulation**. Since it is known that peak drift and acceleration values are always positive, log-transform is introduced. Since a trend is expected, a linear trend function is introduced. The number of Initial Design of Experiments is set to 10.

   :width: 1200

2. Select the **FEM** tab from the input panel. Choose the engine to be OpenSeesPy. For the main script, copy the path to ``CWH.py`` or click choose and navigate to the file. Post-process script field can remain empty and ``params.py`` file is called in the Parameters File field.

   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 1200

3. Select the **RV** tab from the input panel. This should be pre-populated with 14 random variables once ``params.py`` is imported. For each variable, distribution is fixed to be **Uniform** and only the lower and upper bounds should be specified by users. 

.. figure:: figures/SUR-RVtab.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 1200

.. note::
   When user need to manually specify random variables with **add** button, eg. when using a custom FEM application, the user should use drop-down menu to set the distribution as Uniform.


4. Select the **QoI** tab. Here, enter two output names as ``InterstoryDrift_x`` and ``Accel_Roof_x``. 

.. figure:: figures/SUR-QoItab.png

   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 1200

5. Click on the **Run** button. This will cause the back-end application to run SimCenterUQ Engine.

6. When done, the **RES** tab will be selected and the results will be displayed.


* Summary of Results:

Well-trained model will form a clear diagonal line while poorly trained model are more scattered around. The detailed parameter values of the trained Gaussian process model can be found by clicking **Save GP Info** button below the scatter plot.

7.  **Continue Analysis**: If the users are not satisfied with the convergence status, they can continue training by saving the current sample points by clicking **RV Data** and **QoI Data** buttons. Then the user may go back to **UQ tab** and activate **Start with Existing Dataset** option. The user can directly import the sample tables generated by quoFEM.

| Click on the **Run** button, and surrogate model training will be continued. Followings are the results after 144 more simulations.

Users may want to perform additional simulations in a similar way.

.. note::
   Note that in the second training period, 150 initial samples were provided from the data files and 144 more simulations were conducted. However, the number of total samples used to train the surrogate model is displayed as 293 since one simulation is consumed to check the consistency between the user provided model (in the **FEM tab**) and the dataset (in the **UQ tab**).



Verification of the Surrogate model
-----------------------------------

Once surrogate model is constructed, it can be used for various UQ/optimization applications. Here we perform a simple forward analysis to verify the constructed surrogate model. 

1. The constructed surrogate model can be saved by **Save GP Model** button. Two files and a folder will be saved which are **SurroateGP Info File** (default name: ``SimGpModel.json``), **SurroateGP model file** (default name: ``SimGpModel.pkl``) and **Simulation template directory** which contains the simulation model information (``templatedir_SIM``).

.. figure:: figures/SUR-VER1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 1200

.. note::
   * Do not change the name of ``templatedir_SIM``. **SurrogateGP Info and model** file names may be changed.
   * When location of the files are changed, ``templatedir_SIM`` should be always located in the directory same to the **SurroateGP Info file**.

2. Restart the quoFEM (or press **UQ tab**) and select Dakota Forward Propagation method.

   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 1200

3. Select the **FEM tab**  from the input panel and choose **SurrogateGP** application. For the **SurrogateGP Info** field, copy the path to the ``SimGpModel.json`` or click choose and navigate to the file. Similarly, the  **SurroateGP Model field** calls ``SimGpModel.pkl`` file. Once the first file is imported, additional options will be visible. Here, the user can specify the Maximum Allowable Normalized Variance level. The exceedance percentage is provided to help users decision along with the pre-informed accuracy of the surrogate model obtained right after the training session. In this example, we would like to compare two cases: **(CASE 1)** (Ignore the precision tolerance and) **Continue** analysis, **(CASE 2)** **Run Exact FEM simulation** for those samples prediction variance is high. The Maximum Allowable Normalized Variance level is set as 0.08.

4. Once the SurrogateGP Info field in the **FEM** tab is entered, the **RV tab** is automatically populated. The user can select the distribution and its parameters. This example applied the following conditions.

   :width: 1200

5. Once the SurrogateGP Info field in the **FEM** tab is entered, the **QoI tab** is automatically populated. Users are allowed to remove some of the QoIs if not interested but may not add new QoIs or modify the names of existing QoIs.

5. Click on the **Run** button. This will cause the back-end application to launch dakota.

6. When done, the **RES** tab will be selected and the results will be displayed. Below tables compare the results from the two cases.

The peak drifts are well-predicted with the surrogate model (CASE1), while the acceleration predictions are improved by alternating between the surrogate and simulation model (CASE2).

.. note::
   If the user wants to inspect the simulation status or check error/warning messages related to the surrogate model, they can refer to the messages written at: ``{Local Jobs Directory}/tmp.SimCenter/surrogateLog.err``. (Note: ``{Local Jobs Directory}`` is specified from the file-preference in the menu bar.)

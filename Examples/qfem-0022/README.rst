About PLoM
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**PLoM** is an open source python package that implements the algorithm of **Probabilistic 
Learning on Manifolds** with and without constraints ([SoizeGhanem2016]_, [SoizeGhanem2020]_) 
for *generating realizations of a random vector in a finite Euclidean space that are 
statistically consistent with a given dataset of that vector*. 

PLoM functionality in SimCenter tools is built upon `PLoM <https://github.com/sanjayg0/PLoM>`_ 
package (available under MIT license), an opensource python package for Probabilistic 
Learning on Manifolds [ZhongGualGovindjee2021]_. The package mainly consists of python 
modules and invokes a dynamic library for more efficiently computing the gradient of 
the potential, and can be imported and run on Linux, macOS, and Windows platform. 

Problem Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider the problem simulating response of a two-dimensional truss structure with uncertain material properties shown in the following figure.
The goal of the exercise is to demonstrate the use of ``PLoM model`` method under ``SimCenterUQ``.

1. Elastic modulus(``E``): mean :math:`\mu_E=205 kN/{mm^2}` and standard deviation :math:`\sigma_E =15 kN/{mm^2}` (COV = 7.3%)
2. Load (``P``): mean :math:`\mu_P =25 kN` and a standard deviation of :math:`\sigma_P = 3 kN`, (COV = 12%).
3. Cross sectional area for the upper three bars (``Au``): mean :math:`\mu_{Au} = 500 mm^2`, and a standard deviation of :math:`\sigma_{Au} = 25mm^2`  (COV = 5%)
4. Cross sectional area for the other six bars (``Ao``): mean :math:`\mu_{Ao} = 250mm^2`, and :math:`\sigma_{Ao} = 10mm^2` (COV = 4%)

The exercise requires two files: 

1. :qfem-0022:`TrussTemplate.tcl <src/TrussModel.tcl>`

.. literalinclude:: src/TrussModel.tcl
   :language: tcl

2. :qfem-0001:`TrussPost.tcl </src/TrussPost.tcl>`. 

The ``TrussPost.tcl`` script shown below will accept as input any of the 6 nodes in the domain and for each of the two dof directions.

.. literalinclude:: src/TrussPost.tcl
   :language: tcl

PLoM Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Start the application and the UQ Selection will be highlighted. In the panel for the UQ selection, select ``SimCenterUQ`` as the UQ engine. 
   Select ``PLoM Model`` for the UQ method, and use ``Sampling and Simulation`` as the Training Dataset.
   For sampling method, select ``LHS`` with 50 initial simulations for generating training data (with a random seed specified).
   For the new sample number ratio, input 5 by which 250 new realizations will be created from the trained PLoM model.

2. Next select the **FEM** panel from the input panel. This will default in the ``OpenSees`` engine. For the main script copy the path name to ``TrussModel.tcl`` or select **choose** and navigate to the file. For the **post-process script** field, repeat the same procedure for the ``TrussPost.tcl`` script.

3. Next select the **RV** panel from the input panel. This should be pre-populated with four random variables with same names as those having ``pset`` in the tcl script. For each variable, from the drop down menu change them from having a constant distribution to a normal one and then provide the means and standard deviations specified for the problem.

4. Next select the **EDP** tab. Here two response variables ``Node_2_Disp_2`` and ``Node_3_Disp_2`` are defined, which should be consistent with the post-process script.

.. note::   

   The user can add extra EDP by selecting add and then providing additional names. As seen from the post-process script any of the 6 nodes may be specified and for any node either the 1 or 2 DOF direction.

5. Next click on the **Run** button. This will cause the backend application to launch the job. When done the **RES** panel will be selected and the results will be displayed. 
   The landing page of **RES** will show summarize the training information including training sampling number along with two PLoM model trucation plots for PCA and KDE.

If the user selects the **Data** tab in the results panel, they will be presented with both a graphical plot and a tabular listing of the data.
Various views of the graphical display can be obtained by left and right clicking in the columns of the tabular data. If a singular column of 
the tabular data is pressed with both right and left buttons a frequency and CDF will be displayed, as shown in figure below.

The PLoM model can be saved and be loaded back for future use. The ``Save PLoM Model`` button at the bottom of Summary 
page would bring up a dialogue window for saving the model file to a user-defined directory.

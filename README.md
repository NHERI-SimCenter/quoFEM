# uqFEM

This is a SimCenter research application. It's purpose is to provide an application that will allow users to perform uncertainty  quantification and optimization methods utliizng existing finite element applictions. 

It will run the computations locally utilizing lapttop/desktop or remotely utilizing the computational resources made at tt TACC made available through DesignSafe-ci.
